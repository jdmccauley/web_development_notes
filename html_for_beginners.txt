Every HTML document must have the following at the top of the file:
<!DOCTYPE html>
    This declares that the file is in fact an html file.
That is a tag, where a 'tag name' and 'attributes' are contained within the '<>'.
    The 'attributes' are optional.
By default, VS Code makes a 'closing tag' when you add the '>' to a tag.
    A 'closing tag' is a tag with a '/' in front, such as:
    <html> -> the tag
    </html> -> the closing tag
Text contained between the opening tag (first instance of the tag) and closing tag is considered 'inside the tag'.
Self-closing tags look like this:
<html />
    This closes the tag when it is called. It's useful for content that doesn't need multiple lines to be shown on the page, like a file.

Attributes are variables after a tag.
For example, here is a image tag with attribute 'width' as 300:
<img width="300" />
Attributes are separated by a space between themselves and between 'tag names' and a slash if in the tag.

In general, a working level of html is comprised of knowing common tag names and attributes.

Now, the instructor goes over those common tag names and attributes.

Every html page needs at least three tags:
1. html
2. head
3. body

The head and body tags need to be contained within the html tag, where formatting is not important.
HTML doesn't count white space, so as long as the head and body tags are within the html tag, how they are organized doesn't matter.
For personal preference, I'll follow a tabbed format of:
<html>
    <head>
        <body>
        </body>
    </head>
</html>
Indenting is a good idea to keep things organized.
<head>
    The text contained in this tag is what is displayed in the tab of the web browser
<title>
    The text contained in this tag is what is displayed in the tab of the web browser.
<body>
    The text/files contained in this tag is what is displayed in the web page.
<h1>
    This is tag for header, large text.
<h2>...<h6>
    These are different sizes of header content.
<p>
    This is a tag for a paragraph of text.
    Using multiple of these separates the paragraphs with a line of space.
<br/>
    This is a self closing tag or a line break.
<strong>
    This is to bold some text.
<em>
    This is italics.
<button>
    Makes a button that can be clicked.
    Note that javascript is what adds functions to html pages.
<li>
    Bulleted lists.
<ul>
    Unordered list.
<ol>
    Ordered list.
Contain <li> and information between the <ul> and <ol> tags.

That's basic HTML.

CSS is how you add style to pages, more on that next.

For now, check out and play with my index.html file for testing.

I had to look this up, comments in html look like this:
<!--
Some comment here
-->
VS Code colors comments in html with green.
