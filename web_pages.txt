Now to talk about how to make multiple pages for a website with HTML and CSS.

index.html
    This is the home page for a website.

Copy and paste this page and save the files as other_names.html
    The other html files become the other pages.

<a>
    This tak makes a link.
<a href="file.html">some_name</a>
    This is how you make a hyperlink in HTML to another html file.
    Note that the tag is 'a', and the attribute is 'href = "file.html"'
    The text displayed for the link is 'some_name'

So the <a> tag is how you link to other pages, and linking to other html files is how you make the other pages.

So it was mentioned before about having CSS files in a web page directory. What is that for?

Note that you can use directories for pages.
    Include a directory with a slash for linking.
    Ex: href="pages/test.html"
        This is to go down a level.
    Going up a level, use '../upper_level_directory'
        The two dots are how you go up a level.

'External style sheets' are CSS files that are used to define styling for pages.
    You can have a css file seperate from the html pages.
    This removed the need for the <styles> tag in html files.
    To include a css file for styling:
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="cs_file_name.css">
        The 'rel=stylesheet' is very important.

This s great practice to declutter css styling in html files.
You can have many styling files, just name them differently for each page.
