This video covers how to add images to web pages.
This is nearly the end of the series covering the two things needed for a web page: HTML and CSS.
Those two languages are needed for static pages with no functionality.
Functionality is the next thing to read on, with JavaScript.

Most of HTML and CSS is making a layout and filling the layouts with content.

There are two major ways to add images:
1. Add image as a tag with <img>
2. Add image as a background (this is CSS)

You use the image with <img> when it is content.
Using CSS to add image as background is more common.
    This makes the image part of the design, not content.

CSS with backgrounds
It's common to link an image to a home page.
To do this, you can make a link with the <a> tag.
    This is HTML.
    NOTE: Always add text to the link. There needs to be a text visual in case of visually-impared users (using a screen reader)
In the CSS:
    If you class the tag, make a rule for the class where the background is some image.
    Typically make this display: 'inline-block;'
    You can then use pixel numbers to move the text off the screen.
    'background-image: url("path_to_image");
    'background-size: XXXpx;
    'background-repeat: no-repeat;
    'height: XXpx;
    position: relative;'
        It is common practice to size the image to double the display, then resize it down.
        This is to accomodate high and low resolution screens.
    
Image Tags
<img src="path_to_image" alt="decription of image">
    The src tells where to fetch the image.
    The alt tells what is read when using a screen reader.
        Also the alt text helps you show up on search images.
You can add captions with a <h1> (or other size) tag.
Altneratively, use the figure tag:
<figure>
    <img ...></img>
    <figcaption>Description Here</figcaption>
</figure>
    This is a proper way to give an image with caption, using the 'figure' tag.
    You still have the alt text for the image, the caption is different.

Note that a CSS property 'border-radius: X%;'
    This les you turn an image into a circle.

There's a ton of CSS properties. You may use a few commonly, and use some once in a lifetime.
