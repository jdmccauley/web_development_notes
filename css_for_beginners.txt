CSS = Cascading Style Sheets

To add CSS to a html page, you need two things:
1. Tag for 'style' to set as CSS
2. Tag for 'link' to link to another file for CSS code

<style>
    Within this tag, you encase CSS code.
    You write 'rules' for tags with 'selectors'.

<selector>
    This is a CSS tag that contains items like 'selector' which has 'properties'.
    The syntax is similar to a python dictionary, with 'properties' and 'values' within {}
        The thing to note is that properties need ';' at the end of lines

Syntax:
<html>
    <style>
        selector {
            property: value;
        }
    </style>
</html>

The selector 'selects' a tag in the html file, and you can change the 'property'.

For example:
<html>
 <style>
    h1 {
        color: red;
    }
 </style>
</html>

This makes text with the h1 tag red in the web page.
For color, you can declare it 'rgb(value,value,value)' for any color of the color palette.
    VS Code lets you click and drag a pop up to the color, and edits the code to the rgb value.
There's many propertiess: opacity, background (color), font-family (among many other font properties)...

For font-family, you can give many font names and should, since not all machines have the same fonts installed.
