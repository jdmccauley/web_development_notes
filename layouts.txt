<div> tags make dividers, or spanning boxes in the page.
    These were very popular for a long time, in fact so popular that there was an update to make kinds of div tags.
    These include the header, nav, section, and footer tags.
    The div tag was novel since it allows pages to be divided into pages.

When designing a website to look like a given layout (some example website), it's useful to break down the
    page into component sections, and start writing the html/css code to produce those sections.

Learning how to achieve a certain layout needs lots of web searching, which is part of any code development.

Some useful tags:
<header>
<section>
<footer>

How to add spacing around tags:
CSS properties
1. margin
    This allows you to specify pixels for the margins around sections
    One value is on left and right
    Two values gives top/bottom and left/right
    Four values gives margin specified for all directions
2. Padding
    This gives you spacing in your section between the content and the total size of the tag
    Learn more about this later

Note that for these, you can also use % instead of pixels
    Percent lets the page scale with the size of the browser window

Video 4: Build an HTML + CSS Layout with Flexbox in just a few lines of code

This is a continuation of the same topic.

In CSS:
'display: inline;'
    This lets you shape the size of a container (like a section) to be the size of the content
    inline-block lets you specify the size of the blocks

'display: flex;'
    This must be put in a parent section (the html parent)
    This lets you add more css rules:
    'flex-direction: row, column, row-reverse, column-reverse...;'
        This lets you space multiple sections horizontally.

Flexbox
    This is how you make horizontal content in a page. Very important.
    Just look this up because the video is so fast.
    Very powerful thing to understand.
<nav>
    This is a html tag for navigation, you can contain it in a section like a header (for example).
