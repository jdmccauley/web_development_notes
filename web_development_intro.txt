Web Development Notes

I am watching this series of videos on web development:
    https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQojMIhELvM&feature=youtu.be

Video 1: how to make a website

The first thing that the video recommends is to install and start using Visual Studio Code, which I am
    now using.
Next, install the 'Live Server' extension in VS Code.
Open a folder, and create a file named 'index.html'
    This is the first file opened when a website is loaded.
Start with adding '!' to the document, and press enter or tab.
    With this, VS Code creates an empty website template.
Between the two '<body>' tags, write some text.
Finally, right click the file in the file explorer in VS Code, and click 'run with live server'.
This opens a tab in the default web browser at a local host port, and shows the index.html render.
    This also reloads the page each time the html file is saved.

The end, this is my first website with HTML.

I'll make a new text document for the next video.
