I started watching this video out of curiosity, and it's about how to host a website.

Steps:
1. Purchase a domain name
2. Subscribe to a shared hosting server

Purchasing a domain name
There are many places to purchase domains, the one recommended in the video is:
https://iwantmyname.com/

Apparently .com domain names tend to be cheapest, but hardest to find for the desired names.
If you are flexible with the domain name, .com is a great way to go.
The iwantmyname.com offers domain privacy for free, which keeps your personal information private when you go on the domain.
    This is apparently important to get.
Also, .com domains do well on search engine optimization, so that's important to note as well.

Once a domain is owned, nameservers can be changed. These are urls that point to the domain.

Shared Hosting
You purchase subscriptions to these to host the website at the domain.
You upload all of the website files to the host, and they keep a server running with the files, and serve to the domain name.
SSL certificates are good to have for hosting a domain.

hostgator.com is supposedly a great host.
Note that they give you an option to make a gmail with the domain name, that's useful. Google does this for $5/month.

The 'nameserver' is a server's address. You can set this to point from a domain name, letting domain_name.com be served by the nameserver.

You could set up your own computer to be the server, but this can be a security issue.
    If you host on your own machine, your machine can be accessed by users if you do not follow the best precautions.


Outside of the video:
Github Pages
Github lets you host repositories for free.
You get one for your username, and unlimited ones for your projects.

Username site:
Make a repo named 'username.github.io'
    Push your files to the repo.
    Visit https://username.github.io
        Your page is here.

Project site:
You can use themes to design the page and import your README.md as well.
For scratch (my interest):
    1. Make index.html for the repo
    2. Settings ->Github Pages
    3. Set master branch as the source
    4. Visit https://username.github.io/repo_name
        This is the site!

For themes:
    You can convert a repo to a Github Pages site.
    Choose a theme.
    Edit content as you please, the files should all be there for the site.
    Visit https://username.github.io/repo_name
        This is the site!
