Video 6: CSS SELECTORS MADE EASY - HTML CSS Tutorial for Beginners

CSS Rule has 2 things:
1. Selector
2. Property

So far, we've been declaring rules with selectors based on tags.
CSS classes let you make rules for specificly-placed tags.

Additionally, you can note which tag to select within a tag:
section div li{}
    This makes a rule for the list within the div within the section.
You an use commas for multiple:
section div, li{}
    This makes a rule for list and div within section.

In general: 
    spaces in selectors note which tags within tags
    commas make a list of tags to select

Classes
HTML tags can have a 'class', and the class name must not have spaces.
    Ex: <section class="about_me">
For multiple classes, use a space.
    Ex: <section class="about_me contact">
        This section's class is 'about_me' and 'contact'.

CSS rules can then be specific to the class, with a '.'
    Ex: section.about_me{}

Note that like above, spaces and commas can be used.
    Ex: section.about_me div{}
        This makes a rule for the div in section of class 'about_me'.
    Ex: section.about_me div,header {}
        This makes a rule for the div and header in section of class 'about_me'.
    
For multiple classes, use another '.'
    Ex: section.about_me.contact {}
        This makes a rule for sections of class 'about_me' and 'contact'.

Lastly, you can just make rules for classes without noting the tag.
    Ex: .about_me {}
        This makes a rule for all tags of class 'about_me'
    
DRY: Don't Repeat Yourself
This is great practice in web development. Make fewer rules when possible to not repeat yourself.

IDs
IDs work similarly to classes for tags and CSS rules.
To make an id, declare it as an attribute in the tag.
    Ex: <section id="me">

For the CSS rule, use '#' to specify an id
    Ex: #me{}
        This makes a rule for tags of id 'me'.

IDs are only allowed one per page. Try not to use them since classes can work just as well most of the time.

pseudo classes
You can target specific tags with pseudo-classes, which are un-declared attributes.
They are based in the parent-child system, where child tags are contained within parent tags.
Pseudo classes can be called with a ':'
    Ex: section:first-child{}
        This makes a rule for the first section of the page.
